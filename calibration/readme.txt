The calibration calculates the rotaion matrix used by the coordinate transform scripts.
In calibrate_8x8, mark the centers of all transducers.
In calibrate_4x4, mark only the 16 transducers in the middle.
Save the results of calibration as "H_unrot.mat" in simulink/controller_constants/BOD or simulink/controller_constants/BOW.
