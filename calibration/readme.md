# MATLAB calibration scripts (deprecated)
[index](../README.md) \> [calibration](readme.md)

The calibration calculates the rotaion matrix used by the coordinate transform scripts.
In 'calibrate_8x8', mark the centers of all transducers.
In 'calibrate_4x4', mark only the 16 transducers in the middle.

__NOTE: Since the integration of the calibration scripts in [web interface](../webinterface/readme.md), the MATLAB calibration scripts are no longer used.__
