<h1> MATLAB optimization script readme </h1>

This document contains a brief introduction to the MATLAB optimization scripts. These scripts calculate phase delays for an array of 64 ultrasonic transducers. 

<h2> Levitation </h2>

The "levitation" folder contains scripts for single beam levitation method shown in an article by <a href="10.1038/ncomms9661">Asier Marzo</a>. To generate the phase delays, run "solverscript.m". You must have the "MATLAB optimization" folder in your MATLAB path to run this script. 

<h2> Ghost Touch </h2>

The "ghostTouch" folder contains scripts for creating focused acoustic pressure, similarly to <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2817721.2817727">Ghost Touch</a>. To generate the phase delays, use the function "pressurePoints". You must have the "MATLAB optimization" folder in your MATLAB path to run this script.
